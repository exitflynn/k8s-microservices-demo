# K8s microservices demo
This project is meant as a playground for people to learn and build their cloud projects on top of.
The project provides the code for some basic API's written in python, their docker images hosted at [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/exitflynn). Horizontal Pod Autoscaling is enabled and can be tested via the stress tests written using [Locust](https://locust.io/).

The project can be (very) poorly maintained for a while since I mostly work on it under very tight last-minute deadlines when I have to show it at college, better documentation is expected to be added during the summer '24! If you're interested in the project or have ideas about where the project can go, feel free to get in touch!
